# AMRC Connectivity Stack (ACS) ConfigDB Service

This `acs-configdb` service satisfies the **Config Store** component of the Factory+ framework and provides a place for applications consuming Factory+ data to store configuration relating to Factory+ entities. It allows configuration to be centrally managed, and allows generic configuration to be shared between applications.

# AMRC Connectivity Stack (ACS) ConfigDB

> **Note**
> The AMRC Connectivity Stack is an open-source implementation of the AMRC's [Factory+ Framework](https://factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk/).

This `acs-configdb` service satisfies the Config Store component of the Factory+ framework and provides a place for applications consuming Factory+ data to
store configuration relating to Factory+ entities. It allows configuration to be centrally managed, and allows generic configuration to be shared between applications.

For more information about the Config Store module of Factory+, including the API, see the [Factory+ Framework portal](https://factoryplus.app.amrc.co.uk).
